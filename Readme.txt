## Research on Kinect API and Greenfoot platforms for Game development (Issue 2)
There are a number of kinect APIs available for game development in many languages.
The J4K Library created at the University of Florida seems to be a great library available
for use with Java.

Looked at existing sample games developed on Greenfoot from various sources on the internet. 
Game development on greenfoot seems to be very intuitive. It also looks fairly easy to use.
